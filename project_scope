What do i want this game to do?

i want to initialize a game by giving giving 2 cards
The players can bet 
There must be a minimum and maximum bet 

you get the option to split the cards
if not, then continue, otherwise you get two more cards.
then we need to keep track of another set of cards

you get the option to add a card to your deck
if card total > 21, you bust
you lose the bet
if exactly 21 then you win with 3 times return on bet
otherwise continue

the bank draws 2 cards
must continue pulling cards untill 17 is reached. 
if 17 or higher is reached, compare the cards to player

all done
