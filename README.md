# Blackjack-game
First Blackjack game
This is my first full blackjack game.

It has been made after my CS101 course at codeacadamy.
I feel like i went a bit overboard, but i wanted all functionality in it that you see now.

Functionality:
Generating random cards
Keeping score
Main account with money to spend and lose 
Split card option

I was mainly experimenting with all the things ive learned so far. 
I feel like classes haven't been utelized as the should be, but then again i have not that much knowledge about them. The module was very short. 

Happy with the result
